# E-Commerce Shop Learning Project

This repository is a **flexible learning project** where I build an e-commerce shop step by step, starting from a simple console app and expanding into a full-stack application with Java, Spring Boot, a database, and a frontend.

The goal:
- Learn professional **project structure** and **best practices**
- Build **modular, testable, and maintainable code**
- End up with a **portfolio-ready project** that demonstrates practical skills

## ðŸ“š Learning Roadmap

The project is divided into **phases**.  
Each phase builds on top of the previous one.

### Phase 1: Console Application (Weeks 1-12)
- Core domain logic (`Product`, `Cart`, `Order`, etc.)
- Console-based interaction
- Service & Repository separation
- Testing and reporting in console

### Phase 2: REST API with Spring Boot (Weeks 13â€“20)
- Setup Spring Boot project
- Expose domain logic via REST controllers
- Persistence with Spring Data JPA (H2 â†’ PostgreSQL)
- Error handling, validation, authentication
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

### Phase 3: Database & Persistence (Weeks 21â€“28)
- Migrate from in-memory DB to PostgreSQL
- Database migrations with Flyway or Liquibase
- Performance (indexes, caching, pagination)
- Advanced JPA relationships

### Phase 4: Frontend (Weeks 29â€“36)
- React (or Angular) frontend
- Connect frontend to backend REST API
- Build UI for shop (products, cart, checkout, payments)
